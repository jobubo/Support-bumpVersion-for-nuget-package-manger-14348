# Support-bumpVersion-for-nuget-package-manger-14348
Requested here: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/14348

### What would you like Renovate to be able to do?

Hi, first i would like to thank you for renovate. It is awesome! I really like how configurable it is.

Quoting from the detailed [docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#bumpversion):

> Currently this setting supports helmv3, npm, maven and sbt only, so raise a feature request if you have a use for it with other package managers.

I would love the [bumversion](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#bumpversion) feature for Nuget Package manager. So, here's the feature request you asked for :-)

### If you have any ideas on how this should be implemented, please tell us here.

Implement it like you did for helm, npm, ...

### Is this a feature you are interested in implementing yourself?

No
